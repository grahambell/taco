Special Objects
===============

This section describes special objects which can appear as
part of a Taco message.  These JSON objects are embedded in the
values of the message's attributes.  For example they could appear
in the ``args`` attribute of the :ref:`call_function` action, or the
``result`` attribute of the :ref:`result` action.
