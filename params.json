{"name":"Taco","tagline":"","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nTaco is a system for bridging between scripting languages.\r\nIts goal is to allow you to call routines written for one language from\r\nanother.\r\nIt does this by running the second language interpreter in a sub-process,\r\nand passing messages about actions to be performed inside that interpreter.\r\n\r\nIn principle, to interface scripting languages it might be preferable\r\nto embed the interpreter for one as an extension of the other.\r\nHowever this might not be convenient or possible,\r\nand would need to be repeated for each combination of languages.\r\nInstead Taco only requires a \"client\" module and \"server\" script\r\nfor each language, which should be straightforward to install,\r\nand its messages are designed to be generic so that they\r\ncan be used between any combination of languages.\r\n\r\n## Languages\r\n\r\n* Python\r\n\r\n  - [Repository](https://github.com/grahambell/taco-python)\r\n\r\n* Perl\r\n\r\n  - [Repository](https://github.com/grahambell/taco-perl)\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [System documentation](https://github.com/grahambell/taco/tree/master/doc)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
